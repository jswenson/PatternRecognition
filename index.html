            <strong>Bull Flag Channel: </strong>
            The bull flag pattern is found within an uptrend in a stock.  This pattern is named for the resemblance of a flag on a pole.  The bull flag is a continuation pattern which only slightly retraces the advance preceding it.  The technical buy point is when price penetrates the upper trend line of the flag area, ideally on volume expansion.    </article>

            <strong>Bear Flag Channel: </strong>
            The bear flag pattern is found in a downtrending stock.  This pattern is named for the resemblance of an inverted flag on a pole.  The bear flag is a continuation pattern which only slightly retraces the decline preceding it.  The technical sell point is when price penetrates the lower trend line of the flag area, ideally on volume expansion.

            <strong>Triangle: </strong>

            <strong>Falling Wedge: </strong>
            The falling wedge is a generally bullish pattern signaling that one will likely see the price break upwards through the wedge and move into an uptrend. The trendlines of this pattern converge, with both being slanted in a downward direction as the price is trading in a downtrend.

            <strong>Rising Wedge: </strong>

            <strong>Descending Triangle: </strong>
            The descending triangle is the opposite of the ascending triangle in that it gives a bearish signal to chartists, suggesting that the price will trend downward upon completion of the pattern. The descending triangle is constructed with a flat support line and a downward-sloping resistance line.

        <article class="description" id="ascTriangle">
            <strong>Ascending Triangle: </strong>
            The ascending triangle is a bullish pattern, which gives an indication that the price of the security is headed higher upon completion. The pattern is formed by two trendlines: a flat trendline being a point of resistance and an ascending trendline acting as a price support.
